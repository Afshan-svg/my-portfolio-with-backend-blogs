Here are some of the personal projects i have worked on

1. Building an Offline-First Task Manager with Flutter and Node.js
   - Full-stack offline-first task management application
   - Flutter frontend with Bloc Cubit for state management, Shared Preferences for token persistence, SQLite for local task storage with isSynced flag
   - Authentication pages (sign-up, login), homepage for task management, add task page with color picker, form validation, global theming
   - Node.js + Express + TypeScript backend with Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL as remote database
   - JWT-based authentication, bcrypt password hashing, secure protected routes
   - Automatic background synchronization of unsynced tasks when connectivity is restored
   - Connectivity monitoring for seamless online/offline experience
   - Fully dockerized backend and PostgreSQL using Docker Compose with persistent volumes

2. Building a Apple MacBook Pro Landing Page Clone
   - Premium, high-fidelity clone of Apple’s official MacBook Pro landing page
   - Cinematic hero section with animated MacBook opening video and scroll-controlled playback speed
   - Interactive 3D MacBook product viewer using React Three Fiber and Three.js with orbit controls, studio lighting, and snap-back physics
   - Dynamic color and size selection that updates the 3D model in real-time using Zustand global state
   - GSAP + ScrollTrigger for smooth scroll-based animations, model transitions, fade-ins, and parallax masked video effects
   - Fullscreen video showcase section with SVG mask scaling, performance section with staggered image animations
   - Rotating 3D MacBook with video texture on screen in features section, masonry layout highlights, semantic footer
   - Fully responsive with mobile-optimized behavior (disabled heavy scroll animations on tablet/mobile)
   - Clean Git workflow with meaningful commits throughout development

3. Building a BlinkIt UI Clone with Flutter
   - Complete pixel-perfect UI clone of the BlinkIt grocery delivery app
   - Clean folder architecture: data, domain, repository separation
   - Centralized Colors class, Poppins font family (regular & bold), asset management from Figma exports
   - Custom splash screen with timer navigation to login
   - Login screen with social login options and custom reusable button + text widgets
   - Bottom navigation bar (Home, Cart, Category, Print) with stateful screen switching
   - Category screen with horizontal scrolling lists (Vegetables & Fruits, Dairy, Snacks & Drinks, Household Essentials, etc.)
   - Cart screen with custom app bar, CircleAvatar user icon using Stack + Positioned, reusable search text field
   - Print Store screen with full UI implementation
   - Home screen with red app bar, deals sections, Mega Diwali Sale, Crackers, Grocery & Kitchen categories, horizontal scrolling, dividers, and proper layout handling using Expanded, Padding, SizedBox
   - Heavy use of reusable widgets for text, buttons, images, and consistent styling

4. Building a LangChain and Flask Application with Tailwind CSS
   - Real-time AI content generator web application
   - Minimal Flask backend with routes for home page and /generate POST endpoint
   - Tailwind CSS integrated via npm with watch mode for live reloading
   - Frontend form that sends user prompt via fetch API to Flask
   - LangChain + OpenAI API integration (temperature control, secure API key handling via environment variables)
   - Dynamic injection of generated text into the DOM
   - Full deployment and live testing on cloud IDE (Rappal)
   - Proper JSON request/response handling and debugging of CORS/fetch issues

5. Face Mask Detection with CNN: Detailed Implementation Guide
   - Complete face mask detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks
   - Dataset downloaded via Kaggle API (with_mask and without_mask folders)
   - Images resized to 128x128, converted to RGB, stored as NumPy arrays
   - Train-test split (80-20), pixel values scaled to [0,1]
   - CNN architecture: Conv2D(32) → MaxPooling → Conv2D(64) → MaxPooling → Flatten → Dense(128) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(64) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(2, sigmoid)
   - Compiled with Adam optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy
   - Trained for 5 epochs on Google Colab GPU with ~92–94% test accuracy
   - Predictive system that takes any new image, preprocesses it, and outputs “wearing mask” or “not wearing mask”

6. Building a Neural Network for Breast Cancer Classification with PyTorch
   - From-scratch neural network implementation using PyTorch (no Keras)
   - Breast cancer Wisconsin dataset loaded via sklearn
   - StandardScaler preprocessing and train-test split
   - Device-agnostic code (CUDA if available, else CPU)
   - Custom NeuralNet class inheriting from nn.Module with fc1 → ReLU → fc2 → Sigmoid
   - Manual training loop with optimizer.zero_grad(), forward pass, BCELoss, backward(), optimizer.step()
   - Evaluation with torch.no_grad(), model.eval(), accuracy calculation via rounding sigmoid outputs
   - Achieved ~97.3% training accuracy and ~96.4% test accuracy
   - Full emphasis on PyTorch’s dynamic computation graph and flexibility compared to static graph frameworks
